Spine surgery for treatment of various conditions such as degenerative disc disease, scoliosis, spinal deformities, trauma, tumors etc involves highly skill-intensive procedures such as positioning of k-wire, pedicle screw, tools and other implants. HTIC SSR team is developing an affordable system for technology-assisted robotic spine surgery using the IGS technology platform. A CT based surgical planning system is being developed with provision to select procedure specific tools (k-wire, pedicle screw etc.) and position them over the 3D reconstructed anatomy for virtual surgery planning.
